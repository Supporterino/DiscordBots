# Introduction
The intend of this repo was to host the code of some discord bots which were created for my server as QoL updates. Since if found the discord api quite intressting to work with and put some time in it to write "readable" code, I thought i put this repo to public in case someone else sees some use in these bots. Also contributions are very welcome.
