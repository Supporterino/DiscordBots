# Introduction

The intend of this repo was to host the code of some discord bots which were created for my server as QoL updates. Since if found the discord api quite intressting to work with and put some time in it to write "readable" code, I thought i put this repo to public in case someone else sees some use in these bots. Also contributions are very welcome.
Besides the documentation of the bots inside this readme, the source code is documented with typedoc. So you can utilies the typedoc dev dependency to build an documentation [How to build TypeDoc](#documentation).
